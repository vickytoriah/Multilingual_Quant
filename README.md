Practice &amp; Learning process tracker for Python and C++. 

Python is mainly functional, as the focus of the practice is reflecting the solution's logic in C++. Object oriented versions of the solutions may be developed in the future.
Mostly leetcode (type) practice problems solved in Python &amp; C++. More for self-study and further familiarization with best practices, than providing (model) solutions.
