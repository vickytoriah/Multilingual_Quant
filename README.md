    Code Style & Overview
  </summary>
  Python is mainly functional programming, as the focus of the practice is reflecting the solution's logic in C++. For OOP demos, current public repos: [Quant_Practice](https://github.com/vickytoriah/Quant_Practice/)
  Object oriented versions of the solutions may be developed in the future.
  Mostly leetcode (type) practice problems solved in Python &amp; C++. More for self-study and further familiarization with best practices, than providing (model) solutions.
